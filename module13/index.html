        <h1>My Favorite NBA Players</h1>
        <p>My favorite type of NBA Player is a player that can score at will. For this reason some of my favorite players include Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Micheal Jordan. However, I believe that only being a pure scorer does not make you a greater player then someone else who provide value in other ways. For example, even though Magic Johnson was not a established scorer, he is still regarded by most as the greatest point guard ever as well as on of the greatest players overall. This is through his skill in playmaking, defense as well as finishing. This is only one small example and there is many more as well.</p>

        <h2>About This Page</h2>
        <p>Im really passionate about the NBA. My whole life my family has been into basketball and I think thats where my love stems from. Growing up watching LeBron was entertaining. I also saw greats like Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan. I simply wanted to share my favorite NBA players all time and also share a great video about the GOAT debate.  </p>
        <p>I think the GOAT debate will never end in the future we will only just get better and better players. You can look at as many statistics as possible, but there will always be an importance of the context and generation.</p>
        <p>Feel free to share your own thoughts about who you think is the greatest nba player of all time or just simply sharing your favorite players!</p>
