        <h1>My Favorite NBA Players</h1>
        <p>My favorite type of NBA Player is a player that can score at will. For this reason some of my favorite players include Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Micheal Jordan. However, I believe that only being a pure scorer does not make you a greater player then someone else who provide value in other ways. For example, even though Magic Johnson was not a established scorer, he is still regarded by most as the greatest point guard ever as well as on of the greatest players overall. This is through his skill in playmaking, defense as well as finishing. This is only one small example and there is many more as well.</p>
