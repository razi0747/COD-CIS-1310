    <h3>The GOAT Debate & Its Fundamental Issue</h3>
    <p>Many people dispute who the <strong>GOAT</strong> of basketball is, but I believe thats not the right way to look at it. The reality of the situation is that these players played in different generations, that doesnt make them any less great. The game had not evolved as much and as such, it was different. For example, would a player like <b>Jerry West</b> who played in the 1960's and '70s be as good as a player from today? Of course not, but in the time he played, he was a Champ, MVP, All-Star and more.
